      <description>A quick compilation of facts about polycategories together with links to the appropriate litterature. Some are original work.
 Polycategories have been introduced by Szabo in 1975 in Polycategories. Polycategories are &amp;ldquo;categories with many-to-many morphisms&amp;rdquo;, i.e. polymaps have many inputs and many outputs. Polycategories correspond to classical Gentzen sequent calculus. Polycategories compose on one object. Composition of Polycategories is the cut rule. Representable Polycategories, a.k.a. two-tensor polycategories, are linearly distributive categories, see Weakly distributive categories.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD student in the Theoretical Computer Science group at the University of Birmingham. My supervisor is Noam Zeilberger.
My research interests include models of linear logic, categorical semantics of non-classical programming languages - e.g. probabilistic or quantum programming languages - and monoidal categories.
Before that I did a Master in Mathematical Logic and Foundation of Computer Science at the Paris Diderot University. During this period I did a five-month internship under the supervision of Beno√Æt Valiron on the syntax and semantics of a linear probabilistic $\lambda\mu$-calculus.</description>
